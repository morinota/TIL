## What is Spatial Data?

The definition of Spatial Data in this short lecture:

the "data" having "value" and "location"

#### The concept of "Spatial Autocorrelation(空間的自己相関)" relates to 

- "functional relationship between what happens at one point in space and what happens elsewhere"
- ⇒ it means "the degree that **the similarity in values (値の類似性) between observations** is related to **the similarity in locations (位置の類似性) of these observations**".

## Spatial Randomness vs Autocorrelation

In order to better understand the concept of spatial autocorrelation, Let's consider **the absence of spatial autocorrelation**...! = **Spatial Randomness**:

- **Spatial Randomness** is a situation in which the location of an observation **gives no information** about its value.
- i.e. a variable is spatially random if its distribution follows no discernible spatial pattern.
- Spatial autocorrelation can thus be defined as the “absence of spatial randomness”.
