## title

Embarrassingly Shallow Autoencoders for Sparse Data∗

## abstract

Combining simple elements from the literature, we define a linear model that is geared toward sparse data, in particular implicit feedback data for recommender systems. We show that its training objective has a closed-form solution, and discuss the resulting conceptual insights. Surprisingly, this simple model achieves better ranking accuracy than various state-of-the-art collaborative- filtering approaches, including deep non-linear models, on most of the publicly available data-sets used in our experiments.
